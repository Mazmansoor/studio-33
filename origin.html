        Why Studio 33 exists. What the name carries. How we operate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="origin-block">
      <h2>Reason for Being</h2>
      <p>
        Studio 33 was formed to make durable works at a human pace. The aim is not to flood
        feeds but to release pieces that repay attention over time. Every project must earn
        its place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The studio exists to gather disparate abilities—software, narrative, image, sound—under
        one deliberate practice. The goal is coherence, not reach.
      </p>

      <h2>The Name</h2>
      <ul class="story-points">
        <li><strong>33</strong> is a signal to take the long view—decades, not weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Studio</strong> reminds us this is a workshop, not a stage.</li>
        <li>Together, they mark a place where practice compounds quietly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="origin-block">
      <h2>Orientation</h2>
      <p>
        The studio favors clarity over volume. We choose constraints, set few commitments, and
        honor them fully. If a project requires constant promotion, it is not ready to ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        We calibrate for:
      </p>
      <ul class="story-points">
        <li>Works that stand alone without explanation.</li>
        <li>Decisions that preserve integrity even when inconvenient.</li>
        <li>Collaboration with people who value signal over noise.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="origin-block">
      <h2>Operating Cadence</h2>
      <p>
        Releases are infrequent by design. The studio pauses more than it publishes, letting ideas
        prove themselves before they demand attention. When something is shared, it is because it
        is ready to endure.
